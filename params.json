The project includes an improved Doormax learner, a grammar-based learner, a Sokoban domain for BURLAP, and a [Instructional Scaffolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding) framework for the previous learning algorithms.\r\n* [jCaffe](https://github.com/fastturtle/jCaffe), java bindings for [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org).\r\n* A [Simple Neural Network](https://github.com/PhilippeMorere/SimpleNeuralNetwork) developped in java, trained with back-propagation, to experiment a little bit.\r\n* A [Toy Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/PhilippeMorere/BasicReinforcementLearning) example, to experiment Q-Learning.\r\n* [Learning to play Pacman](https://github.com/PhilippeMorere/PacmanRL) with some Q-Learning algorithms\r\n\r\nA few games that I made:\r\n* [Froggy](https://github.com/PhilippeMorere/Froggy) -- Android game, you can download if from the Google play market [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mopgames).\r\n* A Minecraft clone (no code available on GitHub).\r\n* [Bomberman](https://github.com/PhilippeMorere/Bomberman) -- Bomberman-like game, written in C with the SDL, multiplayer.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
